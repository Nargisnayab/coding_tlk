# Create two sets
set1 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
set2 = {3, 4, 5, 6}

# performing  set operations
union_set = set1.union (set2)
intersection_set = set1. intersection(set2)
difference_set1 = set1. difference  (set2)

# printing result
print("Union: ",union_set)
print("Intersection: ",intersection_set)
print("Difference: " , difference_set1)
