Create a list of colors: colors = ['red', 'blue', 'green', 'yellow','purple' ] 

Slice the list to get the second and third colors ('blue' and 'green'), and print it.

Print the length of the colors list.


Example Output:

'blue', 'green' ]


Tips for Solving These Challenges:

Challenge 1: Use the .append() method to add items to a list.

Challenge 2: Modify items by directly accessing their index and assigning a new value.

Challenge 3: Use the .remove() method to remove an item by its value.

Challenge 4: Use slicing to extract a portion of a list (e.g., colors[1:3]) and use len() to find the number of elements.
